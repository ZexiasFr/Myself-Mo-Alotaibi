                <h3> My Favorite Sport</h3>
                <h4> Football </h4>
                <p> Football is my favorite sport cause it requires more comunication and teamwork to win the game and
                    silverware, Aswell as the intensity and the reward is too appetising and I love every part of it, my
                    favorite player and my idol is Robert lewandowski a polish striker who is one of the best in his
                    generation and I idolize him because I play as a striker too and enjoy his football</p>

                <h4> Maths </h4>
                <p> Math is my favorite subject because it is challenging, fun, and easy to learn if you have the right
                    mindset, It requires hard work and smart ideas, It is mostly about problem solving which is needed
                    for all humanity and is the reason our race is still thriving</p>

                <h3> My Favorite Book </h3>
                <h4> Dracula the vampire </h4>
                <p> This is one of the classics a nice slick book only at 40 pages it is a fun experience to read full
                    of tense moments you follow the story of a detective exploring an castle up a hill with a sketchy
                    person living in it whos named "Dracula" It is a very fun experience to me the first time I read it

            <p> My school (Al Ansar) is a school located in Al-Zahra neighborhood which is very peacefull and nice I
                enjoy many subjects in it and the teachers are amazing aswell as the students, fun fact it is also partnered in the same building as Al-Noor school since, its located in jeddah the city i live in, its a wide school in a brand new building, currently i'm not only taking this as a form of education but also alot of reading and philosiphy courses and many programming courses to better my future, One of the reasons I'm so far into proggramming and am writing this website currently is because of my programming teacher mister Prathamesh Manoj, Otherwise I wouldn't be able to type out this website </p>
